abstract = {Creatine kinase (CK) activity and hemopexin concentration were measured in 208 serum samples from 104 normal females and 22 obligate carriers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) 20-40 years old. Logistic discrimination was used to assess the effectiveness of the parameters alone or in combination in identifying DMD carriers. In this approach, a serum sample with particular CK, hemopexin, or a combination of CK and hemopexin values is given a probability that if drawn at random from a defined mixture of controls and carriers, it comes from a carrier. The carrier probability based on the biochemical tests can be directly combined with the carrier probability determined from a woman's pedigree to yield a final posterior probability that she is a carrier. When CK and hemopexin were considered individually, 65 and 27{\%} of the carriers, respectively, could be distinguished from 95{\%} of the controls. When the two tests were used in combination, 82{\%} of the carriers could be distinguished from 95{\%} of the controls. When the two-test method was applied to 93 possible carriers, 35 women were classified as carriers, whereas only 29 were identified using CK alone. This method can be extended to include other variables in order to further improve the identification of DMD carriers. It can also be applied to carrier detection in other genetic disorders.},

abstract = {Since the publication of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) care considerations in 2010, multidisciplinary care of this severe, progressive neuromuscular disease has evolved. In conjunction with improved patient survival, a shift to more anticipatory diagnostic and therapeutic strategies has occurred, with a renewed focus on patient quality of life. In 2014, a steering committee of experts from a wide range of disciplines was established to update the 2010 DMD care considerations, with the goal of improving patient care. The new care considerations aim to address the needs of patients with prolonged survival, to provide guidance on advances in assessments and interventions, and to consider the implications of emerging genetic and molecular therapies for DMD. The committee identified 11 topics to be included in the update, eight of which were addressed in the original care considerations. The three new topics are primary care and emergency management, endocrine management, and transitions of care across the lifespan. In part 1 of this three-part update, we present care considerations for diagnosis of DMD and neuromuscular, rehabilitation, endocrine (growth, puberty, and adrenal insufficiency), and gastrointestinal (including nutrition and dysphagia) management.},
