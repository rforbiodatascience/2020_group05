## Introduction
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a rare, genetic disorder that causes progressive degeneration and atrophy of skeletal and heart muscles (@Science2020). It it caused by a mutation on the dystrophin gene, located on chromosome Xp21, and affects 1 in every 3600 male live-born infants worldwide (@Venugopal2019). Most females with this mutation show no evidence of muscular weakness, but they are able to pass the mutation on to their offspring without showing any symptoms (@Birnkrant2018).


Four enzyme and serum proteins have been linked to carrier status in asymptomatic females. These include creatine kinase (CK), hemopexin (H), lactate dehydroginase (LD) and pyruvate kinase (PK), which are measured in blood samples from serum (@Percy1981).

Since the outcome for patients suffering from DMD is often fatal, it would be of interest to make a model that can predict the carrier status of a female (carrier/non-carrier) based on the four enzymes levels in the blood sample. 




## Materials and Methods
### Pipeline for project
In order to answer the question as to whether carrier status of DMD could be predicted using the levels of the four enzymes, a pipeline was established. 

Figure 1 shows the general workflow of this project. First, the data set with the 192 observations were cleaned and augmented, and the data was visualized in order to look for potential outliers and other aspects that could enhance the analysis. Afterwards, a Principal Component (PC) analysis was performed in order to look for patterns in our data set. Afterwards, based on the levels of the four enzymes, three models were constructed for prediction of carrier status in the 192 patients, which included a linear model, a logistic model and a XXXXX model, based on an artificial neural network (ANN). At last, the model with the highest accuracy was applied to a Shiny application, which can predict the carrier status of a female, based on the four enzyme levels.

### Selection and preparation of data
The data set was obtained from the 1985 book from Andrews et. al., which contained several small data sets from previous studies(@Andrews1985), which originated from the 1981 study from Percy et. al. (@Percy1981). 

The original data had the following attributes, but were seperated into carriers and non-carriers, so the data set in this project consists of two datasets merged together.
