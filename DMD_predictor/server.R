# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
shinyServer(function(input, output) {

    
    # Return the requested dataset ----
    # By declaring datasetInput as a reactive expression we ensure
    # that:
    #
    # 1. It is only called when the inputs it depends on changes
    # 2. The computation and result are shared by all the callers,
    #    i.e. it only executes a single time
    datasetInput <- reactive({
        switch(input$dataset,
               "rock" = rock,
               "pressure" = pressure,
               "cars" = cars)
    })
    
    # Create caption ----
    # The output$caption is computed based on a reactive expression
    # that returns input$caption. When the user changes the
    # "caption" field:
    #
    # 1. This function is automatically called to recompute the output
    # 2. New caption is pushed back to the browser for re-display
    #
    # Note that because the data-oriented reactive expressions
    # below don't depend on input$caption, those expressions are
    # NOT called when input$caption changes
    output$caption <- renderText({
        input$caption
    })
    
    # Generate a summary of the dataset ----
    # The output$summary depends on the datasetInput reactive
    # expression, so will be re-executed whenever datasetInput is
    # invalidated, i.e. whenever the input$dataset changes
    output$summary <- renderPrint({
        dataset <- datasetInput()
        summary(dataset)
    })
    
    # Show the first "n" observations ----
    # The output$view depends on both the databaseInput reactive
    # expression and input$obs, so it will be re-executed whenever
    # input$dataset or input$obs is changed
    output$view <- renderTable({
        head(datasetInput(), n = input$obs)
    })
